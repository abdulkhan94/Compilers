# Compilers
Compiler developed for a subset of LITTLE.
This project is written in Java and uses Antlr as a parser. The language it can compile is a subset of LITTLE, and it can generate tiny assembly code. It has complete register allocation and assumes a 4-register register file on the processor. 

It has support for integers and floating point variables, as well as strings. It also supports If-else if-else constructs and do-while loops. It can also compile any expressions, along with function calls.
